# [Lab 2: Hazelcast](https://github.com/oleksandr-sobkovych/software-architecture-labs)
   Authors: [Oleksandr Sobkovych](https://github.com/oleksandr-sobkovych)
## Prerequisites

- hazelcast 5.2.2
- jdk-17
- maven

## Usage

Launch the Hazelcast cluster named "dev" at localhost with the default configuration.

Then build each Java application with the Maven tool and run it.

**Note:** the **task_3** application requires passing the `-ea` flag to the java binary, so the assert keyword can throw the `AssertionError` exception.
